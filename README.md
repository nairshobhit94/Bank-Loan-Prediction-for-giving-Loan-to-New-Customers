# Bank-Loan-Prediction-for-giving-Loan-to-New-Customers
Create a model and predict the accuracy of the persons who will be able to repay the loan on the basis of some credit factors for the bank.
#1)Importing the Necessary Libraries 

#2)Importing the Dataset 

#3)Reading the Dataset and Preprocessing it

#4)Plotting the number of Persons who are on verge of Bankrupt.

#5)Plotting each and every variable through Graph using Data Visualization using seaborn library.

#6)Checking the Correlation using heatmap and compute the values of correlation

#7)Dropping NA Values from Categorical Variables and fill all the NA values of continuous variables with mean.

#8)Create Dummy Variables for the Categorical Variables

#9)Concatenating all the datasets by merging all the datasets.

#10)Checking if there are any NULL Values or not

#11)Checking the type of Classes 

#12)Removing the Columns which are not important from whom we have created dummy Variables

#13)Applying Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees and PCA Analysis for checking the Prediction and Accuracy it will throw some Unexpected Results.
